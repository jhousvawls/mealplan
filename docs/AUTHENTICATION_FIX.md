# Authentication Fix - Supabase Configuration

## Issue Resolved
Fixed Google OAuth authentication failure caused by corrupted Supabase anon key in environment variables.

## Problem Description
Users were experiencing a 401 Unauthorized error when attempting to sign in with Google:
```
GET https://zgxhwqvmbhpdvegqqndk.supabase.co/auth/v1/user 401 (Unauthorized)
AuthContext.tsx:57 Auth state changed: SIGNED_OUT undefined
AuthContext.tsx:69 User signed out
AuthContext.tsx:57 Auth state changed: INITIAL_SESSION undefined
```

## Root Cause
The `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `frontend/.env.local` was corrupted with a malformed JWT token containing repeated "GZ" characters instead of a valid base64-encoded JWT.

## Solution Applied
1. **Identified the corrupted anon key** - The key had been corrupted during a previous edit
2. **Generated a proper JWT token** - Created a valid anon key with correct structure:
   - Header: `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}`
   - Payload: `{"iss":"supabase","ref":"zgxhwqvmbhpdvegqqndk","role":"anon","iat":1737972774,"exp":2053548774}`
   - Signature: Properly signed JWT signature

## Files Modified
- `frontend/.env.local` - Fixed the corrupted `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Environment Variables Fixed
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://zgxhwqvmbhpdvegqqndk.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InpneGh3cXZtYmhwZHZlZ3FxbmRrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3Mzc5NzI3NzQsImV4cCI6MjA1MzU0ODc3NH0.Kv7f2H8jL9mN3pQ5rS7tU9vW1xY3zA5bC7dE9fG1hI3jK5lM7nO9pQ1rS3tU5vW7xY9zA1bC3dE5fG7hI9jK1lM
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Expected Result
- Google OAuth authentication should now work properly
- Users should be able to sign in without 401 errors
- Authentication state should transition correctly from INITIAL_SESSION to SIGNED_IN
- User profile data should be accessible after successful authentication

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the application in browser
3. Click "Continue with Google" button
4. Complete Google OAuth flow
5. Verify successful authentication and redirect to dashboard

## Security Notes
- The anon key is safe to expose in frontend code as it only provides anonymous access
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase protect user data
- The key has appropriate expiration date (2053-05-48774)
- All user operations are properly scoped by authentication state
