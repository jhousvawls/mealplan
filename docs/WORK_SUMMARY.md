### 🏗️ Technical Implementation

**Backend Analysis Engine:**
```typescript
// Recipe usage analysis with intelligent categorization
async getRecipeUsageAnalysis(mealPlanId: string): Promise<RecipeUsageAnalysis[]>
async getWeeklyAnalysis(mealPlanId: string): Promise<WeeklyAnalysis>

// Features:
- Recipe grouping and usage counting
- Vegetable extraction from ingredients  
- Health score calculation
- Cuisine variety analysis
- Batch cooking opportunity detection
```

**React Query Integration:**
- **New Query Hooks**: `useRecipeUsageAnalysis()` and `useWeeklyAnalysis()`
- **Optimized Caching**: 2-minute stale time, 10-minute garbage collection
- **Automatic Invalidation**: Updates when meal plans change
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript integration with proper generics

**Enhanced MealCard Component:**
