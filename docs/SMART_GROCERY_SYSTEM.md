# Smart Grocery List & Household Staples System

## Overview

The Smart Grocery List system addresses the user's primary need for "getting everything in one visit" by implementing a three-tier grocery list that combines planned meal ingredients, household staples, and manual additions with intelligent duplicate detection and review/approve workflow.

## System Architecture

### Three-Tier Grocery List Structure

1. **Planned Meal Ingredients** (Blue badges: "From planned meals")
   - Automatically generated from 3-4 planned dinners per week
   - Includes quantities and meal context notes
   - Source tracking for transparency

2. **Household Staples** (Purple badges: "Household staple")
   - Weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly recurring items
   - Smart suggestions based on frequency and last purchase
   - Review/approve workflow to prevent over-buying

3. **Manual Additions** (Green badges: "Added manually")
   - One-off items added by users
   - Full category and quantity control
   - Flexible for unexpected needs

## Database Schema

### Household Staples Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE household_staples (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    household_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES households(id),
    item_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'other',
    frequency VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'weekly', -- weekly, biweekly, monthly
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(household_id, item_name)
);
```

### Staples Usage History Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE staples_usage_history (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    household_staple_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES household_staples(id),
    meal_plan_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES meal_plans(id),
    added_to_list_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    quantity VARCHAR(100),
    was_purchased BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    purchased_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### Enhanced Meal Plans
```sql
ALTER TABLE meal_plans 
ADD COLUMN staples_included BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN staples_reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

## Key Features

### üéØ User-Centered Design

Based on user requirements:
- **Primary Focus**: "Getting everything in one visit"
- **Shopping Frequency**: Weekly (Sunday shopping)
- **Meal Planning**: 3-4 dinners per week
- **Breakfast**: General staples (eggs, cereal, bagels, waffles, muffins, OJ, coffee)
- **Family Size**: 2 adults, 2 kids
- **Preference**: Review/approve staples rather than auto-add

### üß† Smart Suggestions

**Staple Suggestion Logic:**
```typescript
// Weekly staples: suggest if 7+ days since last purchase
if (staple.frequency === 'weekly' && daysSinceLastUsage >= 7) {
  suggested = true;
  reason = 'weekly_due';
}

// Bi-weekly staples: suggest if 14+ days since last purchase
else if (staple.frequency === 'biweekly' && daysSinceLastUsage >= 14) {
  suggested = true;
  reason = 'biweekly_due';
}

// Monthly staples: suggest if 30+ days since last purchase
else if (staple.frequency === 'monthly' && daysSinceLastUsage >= 30) {
  suggested = true;
  reason = 'monthly_due';
}

// Catch-all: suggest if not purchased in 21+ days
else if (daysSinceLastUsage >= 21) {
  suggested = true;
  reason = 'not_purchased_recently';
}
```

### üîç Duplicate Detection

**Smart Duplicate Prevention:**
- Case-insensitive item name matching
- Visual indicators for duplicates in staple review
- Automatic quantity consolidation suggestions
- "Already in list" warnings with yellow badges

### üì± User Interface

**Header Controls:**
- **Review Staples (X)**: Shows count of suggested staples
- **Print List**: Integrated with existing print functionality
- **Add Item**: Manual item addition form

**Category Organization:**
- ü•¨ Produce
- ü•õ Dairy  
- ü•© Meat & Seafood
- ü•´ Pantry
- üßä Frozen
- üçû Bakery
- üì¶ Other

**Source Tracking:**
- Color-coded badges indicate item source
- Contextual notes (e.g., "For Monday dinner")
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Implementation Details

### StaplesService Class

**Core Methods:**
```typescript
class StaplesService {
  // Get household staples with mock data support
  async getHouseholdStaples(householdId: string): Promise<HouseholdStaple[]>
  
  // Generate smart suggestions based on frequency and usage
  async getStapleSuggestions(householdId: string, mealPlanId: string): Promise<StapleSuggestion[]>
  
  // CRUD operations for staple management
  async createStaple(staple: Omit<HouseholdStaple, 'id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'>): Promise<HouseholdStaple>
  async updateStaple(id: string, updates: Partial<HouseholdStaple>): Promise<HouseholdStaple>
  async deleteStaple(id: string): Promise<void>
  
  // Usage tracking and purchase history
  async addStaplesToGroceryList(mealPlanId: string, stapleIds: string[], quantities: Record<string, string>): Promise<void>
  async markStaplesPurchased(usageHistoryIds: string[]): Promise<void>
  
  // Household setup and bulk operations
  async setupDefaultStaples(householdId: string): Promise<HouseholdStaple[]>
  async bulkUpdateStaples(updates: Array<{ id: string; updates: Partial<HouseholdStaple> }>): Promise<void>
}
```

### SmartGroceryListView Component

**Key Features:**
- Three-tier item organization
- Real-time staple suggestions
- Interactive review/approve workflow
- Progress tracking and completion status
- Print integration
