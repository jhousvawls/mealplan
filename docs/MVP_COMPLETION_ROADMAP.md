# MVP Completion Roadmap

## Current Status: 70% Complete ✅

**Live Frontend**: https://meal-planner-mu-seven.vercel.app

## Phase 1: Backend Deployment (Priority: HIGH)

### 1.1 Choose Backend Platform
**Options:**
- **Railway** (Recommended) - Easy Node.js deployment, good free tier
- **Render** - Simple deployment, automatic builds from Git
- **Heroku** - Classic choice, reliable but paid
- **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Good performance, reasonable pricing

### 1.2 Backend Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Prepare backend for deployment
cd backend
npm run build  # Ensure build works

# 2. Add production environment variables
# - PORT (usually provided by platform)
# - NODE_ENV=production
# - SUPABASE_URL
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (if using recipe parsing)

# 3. Update package.json with start script
"scripts": {
  "start": "node dist/index.js",
  "build": "tsc"
}
```

### 1.3 Update Frontend API URL
Once backend is deployed, update Vercel environment variable:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel env add VITE_API_URL production
# Enter: https://your-backend-url.com
vercel --prod  # Redeploy frontend
```

## Phase 2: Core MVP Features Completion

### 2.1 Essential Features Status
- ✅ User Authentication (Google OAuth + Test User)
- ✅ Dashboard Overview
- ✅ Weekly Meal Planning Interface
- ✅ Navigation & UI/UX
- ⏳ Recipe Management (Basic CRUD)

  - Fix any API connection issues
  - Ensure recipe favorites work

#### Grocery List Generation
- **Status**: UI implemented, needs testing
- **Tasks**:
  - Verify grocery list generation from meal plans
  - Test printable grocery list functionality
  - Ensure household staples integration works

#### Recipe Import
- **Status**: Backend implemented, needs frontend testing
- **Tasks**:
  - Test URL-based recipe import
  - Verify social media recipe parsing
  - Test manual recipe entry

## Phase 3: Testing & Polish

- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verification
- [ ] Performance optimization

### 3.2 Bug Fixes & Polish
- [ ] Fix any remaining TypeScript errors
- [ ] Optimize loading states
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add loading indicators

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### 4.1 Security & Performance
- [ ] Environment variable security audit
- [ ] API rate limiting verification
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Error logging setup

### 4.2 Documentation
- [ ] User guide creation
- [ ] API documentation update
- [ ] Deployment guide finalization

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Priority 1: Backend Deployment
1. **Choose platform** (Recommend Railway for simplicity)
2. **Deploy backend** with environment variables
3. **Update frontend API URL** and redeploy
4. **Test end-to-end functionality**

### Priority 2: Feature Verification
1. **Test recipe management** - Add, edit, delete recipes
2. **Test meal planning** - Assign recipes to meal slots
3. **Test grocery lists** - Generate from meal plans
4. **Test recipe import** - URL parsing functionality

### Priority 3: Bug Fixes
1. **Fix any connection errors** between frontend/backend
2. **Resolve TypeScript issues** if any remain
3. **Optimize user experience** - loading states, error messages

## Success Criteria for MVP

### Must Have (MVP Complete)
- ✅ User can sign up/login
- ✅ User can view dashboard
- ✅ User can navigate meal planning interface
- ⏳ User can add/manage recipes
- ⏳ User can plan meals for the week
- ⏳ User can generate grocery lists
- ⏳ User can import recipes from URLs

### Nice to Have (Post-MVP)
- Advanced recipe search/filtering
- Meal plan templates
- Nutritional information
- Shopping list optimization
- Family sharing features
- Mobile app

## Estimated Timeline

- **Backend Deployment**: 1-2 days
- **Feature Testing & Fixes**: 2-3 days
- **Polish & Documentation**: 1-2 days

**Total MVP Completion**: 4-7 days

## Resources Needed

### Technical
- Backend hosting platform account
- Domain name (optional)
- SSL certificate (usually included with hosting)

### Testing
- Multiple devices for testing
- Different browsers for compatibility
- Test user accounts

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Backend deployment complexity** - Mitigate with Railway/Render
2. **Environment variable issues** - Document all required variables
3. **API connection problems** - Test thoroughly after deployment
4. **Performance issues** - Monitor and optimize as needed

### Backup Plans
- Keep local development environment working
- Document rollback procedures
- Maintain staging environment for testing

## Post-MVP Roadmap

1. **User Feedback Collection**
2. **Performance Monitoring**
3. **Feature Enhancement Based on Usage**
4. **Mobile App Development**
5. **Advanced Features Implementation**
